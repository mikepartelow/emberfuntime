There was nothing suspicious about the job preceding the umount failure. Farmer to be put back in FC active farm.\nThe current belief is that this was caused by a process using the loopback device, and if it occurs again debugging code will be implemented to gather more information.\n\nOne potential \"fix\" is to use the fuser command to identify any processes that are still using the mounted loop device when we are trying to umount it and kill those processes then try umount again. This assumes that it is better to kill off the offending process and keep going then to follow any other course of action.\n\n:::::::::::\n\nThis has brought to light 3 issues:\n1) umount failure should raise it's own exception.\n2) some or all farmer exceptions should cause the farmer to disable itself.\n3) currently there is no mechanism for a farmer to disable him(or her)self.\n\n:::::::::::\n\nYour test has has stopped due to a farmer exception\n\nFor more info, visit http://calculus.efi.com/requests/586107#586107xt0.
