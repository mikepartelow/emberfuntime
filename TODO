- re-org code into MVC etc. dirs

- spinner while waiting for issues to load
- try loading 64k of issues file.  it seems very slow to render.  is the problem www.rb or ember?  
  - slowness: trigger('update')
    - apparently it's not needed at all
    - even if it is don't reference #issues-table, generalize
- update issue count based on # shown in table        

- filter/sort via URL
